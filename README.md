# push_swap

A project about sorting algorithms with a focus on linked lists

This project is original from the "sorting" point of view: we have a set of instructions to use and we do not consider runtime or ressource use, instead we need to optimize the number a these "instructions" we should use to sort the int array

I used two algorithms: binary radix and a custom technique to break the array into chunks to be sorted
